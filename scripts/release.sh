# Headings start at level 3: CHANGELOG.md reserves `##` for version headings,
# and internal/changelog splits entries on exactly that.
PROMPT="You are writing a GitHub release changelog for Reclaim — a self-hosted media codec audit and re-encode tool for Plex/NAS libraries.

Release: ${NEW_TAG}
Previous release: ${LATEST}

Commits in this release:
${COMMITS}

Changed files summary:
${DIFF_STAT}

Write a concise, user-focused release changelog in GitHub-flavoured Markdown. Format it as:
- A short opening sentence describing the overall theme of this release (one line, no heading)
- A \"### What's Changed\" section with bullet points grouped under \"#### Features\", \"#### Fixes\", and \"#### Improvements\" subheadings. Use plain English, not commit message jargon. Skip merge commits and version bump commits.
- A \"### Docker\" section with the exact pull command: \`docker pull ghcr.io/${REPO}:${NEW_TAG#v}\`

Rules:
- Output the Markdown directly. Do NOT wrap the whole response in a code fence, and do NOT add any preamble such as 'Here is the changelog'.
- Do NOT include a title heading with the version number — that is added automatically.
- Headings must start at level 3 (###). Never use # or ##.
- Keep it tight — no filler, no 'this release includes' boilerplate. Max ~200 words."
